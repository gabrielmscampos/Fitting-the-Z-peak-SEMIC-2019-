# Fitting the Z peak SEMIC 2019
In this repository is available all the code used in the study and the references used.

Pre-filtered Run2011A data can be found at https://github.com/cms-opendata-education/zboson-exercise or at the data folder of this repository. All fitting tools were used from LMFIT (https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/) library.

All mathematical functions and probability density functions were hardcoded in the script and the convoluted integral is implemented by numerical integration.

In a nutshell the best mathematical model found to fit the Z‚Å∞ resonance peak was given by the equation

This model produced the fallowing fit along the selection criteria in the pT and eta:
